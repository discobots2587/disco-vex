This is a standard README for VEX before you commit or USE this code. 

These folders are organized by robot team, 

for example,  
Alpha is the 2587 robot team

Zeta is the 2587 Z robot team

Each team will have its own folder and should only use common libraries.  

Please don't commit a common library file in your subteam's folder, instead call the library file in  
VEX/Generic_Libraries   , that way code only changes in one place and other teams can use the library. 

IF you have read this document, please indicate your name below and Commit your changes.
